### Next Steps

- lift cart state to avoid prop-drilling (probably use a cart context)
- add react-testing-library user tests, e.g. "user clicks item, item appears in cart"
- add loading state spinner on landing view when fetching menu
- calculate total of order
- add count tracking of items in order
- include ability to add or remove items from cart
- include proper $0.00 currency format of displayed options
- leverage ref on cart component to handle onBlur dismissal
- clean up api response type (used any due to time constraints)
- more flashy styling, this is really bare!
